# Home Office Spend 2020

Light analysis of data of Home Office procurement card spend over Â£500 for 2020.

There was a [tweet on 26th March 2020](https://twitter.com/lloydhardy/status/1375363511962980352?s=20) with a screenshot of some Home Office spending. I just got curious about how easy it would be to harvest, clean and summarise the spending data.
